# Purpose

**TL;DR**: To prevent build failures caused by including different versions of the support libraries. 

Some Cordova plugins include [Android Support Libraries](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index.html) to faciliate them.
Most commonly, these are now included into the Cordova project by specifying them as Gradle dependencies (see the [Cordova plugin spec documenation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/plugin_ref/spec.html#framework)).

Example plugins:
- [cordova-diagnostic-plugin](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin)
- [Telerik ImagePicker plugin](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/ImagePicker)
- [cordova-plugin-local-notifications](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/)
- [cordova-plugin-facebook4](https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4)

The problem arises when these plugins specify different versions of the support libraries. This can cause build failures to occur, which are not easy to resolve without changes by the plugin authors to align the specified versions. See these issues:

- [phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner#480](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner/issues/480)
- [cordova-plugin-facebook4#507](https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4/issues/507)
- [cordova-plugin-local-notifications#1322](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/issues/1322)
- [cordova-diagnostic-plugin#211](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/211)

To resolve these version collisions, this plugin injects a Gradle configuration file into the native Android platform project, which overrides any versions specified by other plugins, and forces them to the version specified in its Gradle file.

# Installation

    $ cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release
    
Just install the plugin and that's it. It should fix should build.

# Different library versions

## Default version
By default, the `master` branch of this repo and corresponding npm release, will be made to specify the most major version of the most recent release of the support libraries - [see here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html) for a list recent versions. "Most recent release" means the highest major version that will not result in an Alpha or Beta version being included.

For example, if the most recent versions are:
- `26.0.0 Beta 2`
- `25.4.0`

Then this plugin will default to `25.+` because `26` is still in Beta.

## Other versions

In some cases, you may want to specify a different version of the support libraries. For example, [Telerik ImagePicker plugin v2.1.7](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/ImagePicker/tree/2.1.7) specifies `v23` because it contains code that is incompatible with `v24+`. 

In this case, including the default version of this plugin will still result in a build error. So this plugin provides branches for various older major versions of the support libraries.
 
In the above case, you'd want to install the [v23 branch](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release/tree/v23) of this plugin which specifies support library versions of v23.
Because Cordova doesn't support tags in plugins sourced from npm, you'll need to install this version directly from the git repo:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#v23
    
The following branches currently exist:
    
- [master](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release) (default)
    - The most recent major release
    - Currently uses `25.+`
    - Install with: `cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release`
    - Or: `https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release`
- [edge](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release/tree/edge)
    - The most recent bleeding-edge release
    - Uses `+`
    - Install with: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#edge`
- [v25](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release/tree/v25)
    - The highest v25 version
    - Uses `25.+`
    - Install with: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#v25`
- [v24](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release/tree/v24)
    - The highest v24 version
    - Uses `24.+`
    - Install with: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#v24`
- [v23](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release/tree/v23)
    - The highest v23 version
    - Uses `23.+`
    - Install with: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#v23`
- [v22](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release/tree/v22)
    - The highest v22 version
    - Uses `22.+`
    - Install with: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#v22`
    
# Example cases

## Example 1

Forces the latest release version of the support libraries to fix the build issue.

1. `cordova create test1 && cd test1/`
2. `cordova platform add android@latest`
3. `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-facebook4@1.9.1 --save --variable APP_ID="123456789" --variable APP_NAME="myApplication"`
4. `cordova compile`

Observe the build succeeds and in the console output is `v25.3.1` of Android Support Library:

    :prepareComAndroidSupportSupportV42531Library

5. `cordova plugin add de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification@0.8.5`
6. `cordova compile`

Observe the build failed and in the console output is higher than `v25.3.1` (e.g `v26.0.0-alpha1`) of Android Support Library:

    :prepareComAndroidSupportSupportV42600Alpha1Library

7. `cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release`
8. `cordova compile`    

Observe the build succeeds and in the console output is latest release version of Android Support Library.

## Example 2

Forces the v23 version of the support libraries to fix the build issue, because v2.1.7 of the ImagePicker only works with v23.

1. `cordova create test2 && cd test2/`
2. `cordova platform add android@latest`
3. `cordova plugin add https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/ImagePicker.git#2.1.7`
4. `cordova compile`

Observe the build succeeds and in the console output is `v23.4.0` of Android Support Library:

    :prepareComAndroidSupportSupportV42340Library
    
5. `cordova plugin add cordova.plugins.diagnostic@3.6.5`

Observe the build failed and in the console output is higher than `v23.4.0` (e.g `v26.0.0-alpha1`) of Android Support Library:

    :prepareComAndroidSupportSupportV42600Alpha1Library
    
7. `cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release`
8. `cordova compile`

Observe the build still failed and in the console output is still higher than `v23.4.0` (e.g `v25.3.1`) of Android Support Library:

    :prepareComAndroidSupportSupportV42531Library
    
9. `cordova plugin rm cordova-android-support-gradle-release`
10. `cordova plugin add https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release#v23`
11. `cordova compile`
